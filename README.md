# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a Python Data Analysis project, with the goal of predicitng wether the customer will churn or not.
I grouped together the data I would like to use and then put them through a classification tree to get a prediction
After getting my prediciton of the data, I compared it to the training set and the test set.
I achieved a higher prediction accuracy than my proffesor with over 71% accuracy
I then exported the file to a csv
